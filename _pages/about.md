Alark Joshi is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of San Francisco, where he works on data visualization projects for improved neurosurgical planning and treatment. His research focuses on developing and evaluating the ability of novel visualization techniques to communicate information for effective decision making and discovery. He received his postdoctoral training at Yale University, where he was a core member of the BioImage Suite team, whose mission is to develop and disseminate advanced image analysis and visualization software for widespread use.

His work has led to novel visualization techniques in fields as diverse as computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric physics, medical imaging and cell biology. Through the illustration-inspired visualization techniques that he developed, atmospheric physicists are able to visualize the time-varying nature of hurricanes more effectively. Some of his current work deals with developing and evaluating the performance of neurosurgeons on novel visualization and interaction techniques.

He received his Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Maryland Baltimore County, his M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota and his B.S. degree from the University of Pune, India. He owes his interest in medical visualization to his stints at VitalImages Inc. and Siemens Corporate Research.

He blogs about recent advances in data visualization at the Visualization Blog and is a contributing author at the graphics and visualization website Vizworld.com.
